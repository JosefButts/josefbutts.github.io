/*
The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
How do we assign a function to a variable?
Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs and OPTIONALLY return a single value, how do we specify inputs, and how do we return a value?
NOTE: Primitive (simple) values are passed to a function BY COPY, complex by reference. Try it!
Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced),
that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures! (See: our meeting-room app for an example!) (ALSO, see: Understanding JavaScript Closures with Ease)
